# Highlight of the Day
A social media/journaling app inspired by TheSlap from the Nickelodeon show Victorious. Users will share an important event, or highlight, that occured each day while including how they are feeling under it (such as "Happy"). This allows users to display emotions in an easy and healthy way. 

I am creating this app using React.js and MongoDB.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# How to test/run
In one node, use the command "npm start" on the entire project, while in another node update the directory to the backend folder and use the command "nodemon server".
